#summary What happens when the range of the GADT type constructor is a type function invocation?
#labels crazy

= Introduction =

Imagine following type function:
{{{
tuple :: Nat ~> *
{tuple 0t} = ()
{tuple 1t} = a
{tuple (2+m)t} = (a, {tuple (1+m)t})
}}}

Now, let's see how this function can be used to parametrize a GADT:

{{{
data Tuple :: n ~> {tuple n} where
  Unit :: Tuple 0t
  Item :: Int -> Tuple 1t
  Pair :: Int -> Int -> Tuple 2t
}}}

= Details =

The type constructor's range must be {*n}.

= Open Questions =

  * dies this construction work at all?
  * can this construction be used to implement parametrized modules?
  * ... type classes? _gasp!_ How can dictionary passing be emulated? Open type classes too?
