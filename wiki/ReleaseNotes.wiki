= Release 1.5 _(2011-04-29)_=

Release 1.5 marks the first milestone without major involvement of [http://code.google.com/u/@UBJVQVdRBxdNWwR9/ Tim], who is directing his attention towards [http://code.google.com/p/trellys Trellys], a compiled language with dependent types. Big thanks to him for all the awesome work on Î©mega in the past, we will miss his vision, wisdom an profound understanding of the matter. With some luck he can still contribute an occasional fix here or there.

== Licensing ==
The highlight of this release is the change of licensing terms to become a pure 3-clause BSD license. Previously an additional clause prohibited use in commercial settings without written consent (issue 74). 

== Syntax ==
Additional syntax extensions can be derived. These include:
  * left-associative variants to `Pair`, `List` and `Record` (spelled as `LeftPair` etc.)
  * nullary `Unit` and unary `Item` extensions

== Bug Fixes ==
Many bugs have been fixed, most notably displaying higher-rank (issue 75) and arrow (issue 83) types. Thanks for the attached patches we received!

== Obtaining the Release ==
Please visit [http://code.google.com/p/omega/downloads/list the downloads tab] for getting the sources. You will need a modestly recent GHC to compile it.

== Format of the Download Archive ==
The `Omega15` file has been compressed by following commands (on a linux machine)
{{{
zip -v -r Omega15 distr -x \*.pdf -x \*.ps --to-crlf
zip -v -u Omega15 distr/*.pdf distr/*.ps
}}}
So all text files are with CR/LF line endings but the `.pdf` and `.ps` ones, which are left binary.
