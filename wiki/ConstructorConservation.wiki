#summary A proof technique that is surely widely known.

= Introduction =

When looking at all equality proofs dealing with `Nat`s there is a common principle: each line mentions the same number of `S` and `Z` in the patterns as on the RHS.

I call this _conservation of constructors`.

Is there any literature on it?

Such a constraint surely restricts the number of candidates for a proof-search algorithm.

= Property Conservation =

The above principle is a pretty strong one, we may desire to forget some (exact) constructors, but count _depth_. I.e. for tree-like data we may be interested in the conservation of the _fringe_, or the _contour_ (fringe with depth of each element). For sorting we may want conservation of the _permutation_.
