#summary A proof technique that is surely widely known.

= Introduction =

When looking at all equality proofs dealing with `Nat`s there is a common principle: each line mentions the same number of `S` and `Z` in the patterns as on the RHS.

I call this _conservation of constructors`.

Is there any literature on it?

Such a constraint surely restricts the number of candidates for a proof-search algorithm.
