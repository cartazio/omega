= Introduction =

An unusual approach to retrofit constructors with type-level rules.

Consider the length function
{{{
length [] = 0
length (a:as) = 1 + length as
}}}
This is a catamorphism and has the type `length :: [a] -> Int`. But what if we want `Nat' a` as the range? And we also want (gasp!) a correctness guarantee?

The idea is to locally augment the constructors with _theorems_:
{{{
let theorem (:) :: Nat' n -> Nat' (1+n)t
    theorem [] :: Nat' 0t
}}}
And then proceed defining:
{{{
lengthNat [] = 0v
lengthNat (a:as) = (1+lengthNat as)v
}}}

Several points to consider:
  * Any type coming from the theorems needs to be hidden existentially.
  * Occulted type transformes on constructors that are locally refined?
  * Automatic links to other wiki pages
