= Introduction =

Usually programmers encounter data types as isolated or mutually recursive entities.

{{{
data Nat = Z | S Nat
data Foo = F Bar
data Bar = B Foo
}}}


= The Idea =

We argue that actually the different data types are just the _apparent_ parts of a big data type, just like there might be visible tips of a great iceberg.
{{{
data Iceberg :: Tag ~> * where
  Iceberg〈Nat〉Z :: Iceberg〈Nat〉
  Iceberg〈Nat〉S :: Iceberg〈Nat〉-> Iceberg〈Nat〉
  Iceberg〈Foo〉F :: Iceberg〈Bar〉-> Iceberg〈Foo〉
  Iceberg〈Bar〉B :: Iceberg〈Foo〉-> Iceberg〈Bar〉
}}}
This idea is an old one. Sheard & Ahn
